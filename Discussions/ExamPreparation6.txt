1- Disjoint sets:
A-It can't be, there is not path compression done also the tree size under 1 is too big to be done with wieghted.
B- It can't be, because 0 is bigger than 9 tree.
C- Impossible, tree height is too big, it should had appended it to the root directly not the child.
D- Possible
E- Impossible, the height of 1-6-8-9 is bigger than the height of the bigger root 
F- Impossible, the height of root at 1 is bigger than the height of the parent of root 1 : 0

2- Weighted Quck Union:
a- Impossible
b- 2,0 -> 4,2 -> 6,2 -> 3,5 -> 3,4
c- Quck find, Quick union, Weighted Quick union, Weighted Quick union with path compression.
